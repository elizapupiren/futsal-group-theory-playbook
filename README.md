# Futsal Group Theory Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook is designed for youth futsal coaches who want to develop their players' sensory-motor perception and passing ability through structured drills. Each drill is explicitly connected to a fundamental concept from group theory, providing a unique lens through which coaches can understand player movements and passing patterns.

The goal is to create training sessions that are not only effective for skill development but also intellectually stimulating, helping players (and coaches) appreciate the mathematical structures underlying team sports.

## Drills

1. [Triangle Passing Drill](drill_1.md) – linked to **Cyclic Group (Rotation)**
2. [Peripheral Vision Small-Sided Game](drill_2.md) – linked to **Dihedral Group (Symmetries of a Square)**
3. [Wall Pass Challenge](drill_3.md) – linked to **Symmetric Group (Permutations)**

## How to Use This Playbook
- Read each drill description, setup, and instructions.
- Review the group‑theory connection to understand how the players’ movements exemplify that concept.
- Emphasize the coaching points during the session.
- Adapt the drills to your team’s age and skill level.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit pull requests with additional drills or refined group‑theory explanations. The aim is to build a practical, evolving resource for the coaching community.
